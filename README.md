VR Language Learning App - Pearson Collab - Week 03 of XR Bootcamp Prototyping

Prototype Demo Video - https://vimeo.com/786439621

## Overview
Bubblingo is a VR language-learning app that introduces words and phrases from various contexts in the target language with a simple, fun and fast-paced interface. It uses the “Drill and Kill” learning philosophy that helps strengthen the learner’s essential vocabulary.
**The app was built for a Oculus / Meta Quest 2 headset using Unity and XRIT SDK.**

## Inspiration
When you're hitting a new town or beach for day, it's always good to be able to say '"toilet", "menu", or in case of total language meltdown "do you speak English"? ‍
The inspiration to focus on a visually appealing and intuitive mini-games format came from the Drops Mobile App. The app effectively uses a variety of fast-paced quiz methods to reinforce knowledge of words and phrases, with a monochromatic and minimalist user interface.

## Key features
- extended Unity XR Interaction Toolkit SDK
- integrated cartoon style UI design with cartoon hands, 3D illustration models, environment and shaders
- custom hand animations for point, grip and release
- 4 different bubble-themed quiz methods with physics and grabbing mechanics
- animations and audio signifiers and feedbacks 
- integrated voice pronunciation with text-to-speech
- code refactoring to incorporate principles of OOP and allow future extendibility

## Bugs and stretch goals
- The app currently does not have HUD which would include a timer, progress bar, pause and exit button.
- The performance evalauation for accuracy and timing has not been implemented yet.
- The code has not been refactored to manage the randomization of phrases and methods during gameplay as depicted in the demo video.
